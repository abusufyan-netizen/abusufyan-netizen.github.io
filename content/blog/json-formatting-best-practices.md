# JSON Formatting Best Practices for Clean APIs

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become the universal language of data exchange on the web. With over **90% of modern APIs** using JSON as their primary data format, understanding how to work with it efficiently is a must-have skill for every developer.

## Why JSON Formatting Matters

Poorly formatted JSON leads to:
- **Debugging nightmares** — minified JSON is nearly impossible to read
- **Hidden bugs** — missing commas, extra brackets, and type mismatches
- **Team confusion** — inconsistent naming conventions across endpoints
- **Performance issues** — bloated payloads with unnecessary data

## Best Practice #1: Use Consistent Naming Conventions

Choose **one naming convention** and stick with it across your entire API:

```json
{
  "userId": 12345,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "emailAddress": "john@example.com",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-03T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**camelCase** is the most common convention in JavaScript/TypeScript APIs. Avoid mixing `snake_case`, `PascalCase`, and `camelCase` in the same response.

## Best Practice #2: Always Validate Before Production

Never trust JSON data blindly. Validate it at every boundary:

1. **Client-side** — Validate before sending requests
2. **Server-side** — Validate incoming payloads against schemas
3. **Database layer** — Validate before storage

Use our [JSON Formatter](/tools/json-formatter/) to quickly validate and beautify any JSON payload during development.

## Best Practice #3: Use Proper Data Types

```json
{
  "count": 42,
  "price": 19.99,
  "isActive": true,
  "tags": ["web", "api", "json"],
  "address": null
}
```

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Storing numbers as strings: `"count": "42"` ❌
- Using strings for booleans: `"isActive": "true"` ❌
- Using `0` or `1` for booleans: `"isActive": 1` ❌

## Best Practice #4: Handle Null Values Correctly

Be explicit about missing data:

```json
{
  "middleName": null,
  "phoneNumber": null
}
```

Don't omit fields entirely — this makes it ambiguous whether the field doesn't exist or has no value.

## Best Practice #5: Use ISO 8601 for Dates

Always use ISO 8601 format with timezone information:

```json
{
  "createdAt": "2026-05-03T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-05-03T14:45:30+05:00"
}
```

## Best Practice #6: Paginate Large Responses

Never return unbounded arrays. Use pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "perPage": 20,
    "total": 150,
    "totalPages": 8
  }
}
```

## Tools for JSON Development

Keep these tools bookmarked for daily JSON work:

- **[JSON Formatter](/tools/json-formatter/)** — Beautify and validate JSON instantly
- **[Base64 Encoder](/tools/base64-encoder/)** — Encode/decode Base64 payloads
- **[Hash Generator](/tools/hash-generator/)** — Generate checksums for data integrity

## Conclusion

Clean JSON is the foundation of reliable APIs. Follow these best practices consistently, validate your data at every step, and use proper tooling to catch issues before they reach production.

**Try our [JSON Formatter](/tools/json-formatter/)** to start formatting your API responses like a pro.
