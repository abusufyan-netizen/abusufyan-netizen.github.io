# Base64 Encoding: What It Is and When to Use It

Base64 is one of those fundamental concepts every developer encounters but few truly understand. This guide breaks down exactly what Base64 encoding is, how it works, and when you should (and shouldn't) use it.

## What Is Base64?

Base64 is a **binary-to-text encoding scheme** that converts binary data into a string of ASCII characters. It uses 64 characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+`, and `/`, with `=` for padding.

The name "Base64" comes from the fact that it uses **64 different characters** to represent data.

### How It Works

1. Take the binary input data
2. Split into groups of 6 bits (instead of the usual 8)
3. Map each 6-bit group to one of 64 ASCII characters
4. Pad with `=` if the input length isn't divisible by 3

**Example:**
```
Input:  "Hi"
Binary: 01001000 01101001
Base64: SGk=
```

The encoded output is always **about 33% larger** than the original data.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Data URIs in HTML/CSS

Embed small images directly in your code without extra HTTP requests:

```css
.icon {
  background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...);
}
```

**When to use:** Icons under 2KB where reducing HTTP requests matters.
**When to avoid:** Large images — the 33% size increase isn't worth it.

### 2. Email Attachments (MIME)

Email protocols only support text. Base64 encodes binary attachments (images, PDFs, zip files) into text that can travel through email systems.

### 3. API Authentication

HTTP Basic Authentication encodes credentials in Base64:

```
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

⚠️ **Important:** Base64 is **not encryption**. It's easily reversible. Always use HTTPS for authentication.

### 4. JSON Payloads with Binary Data

JSON doesn't support binary data natively. Base64 lets you embed images, files, or binary data in JSON:

```json
{
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "content": "JVBERi0xLjQKMS...",
  "contentType": "application/pdf"
}
```

### 5. JWT Tokens

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) use Base64URL encoding for the header and payload:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obiJ9.signature
```

### 6. URL-Safe Data Transfer

Base64URL variant replaces `+` with `-` and `/` with `_`, making it safe for URLs and filenames.

## When NOT to Use Base64

- **Large files** — The 33% size overhead adds up quickly
- **Security** — Base64 is NOT encryption; it's trivially reversible
- **Database storage** — Store binary data as BLOB, not Base64 strings
- **Images on websites** — Use actual image files with CDN for production

## Base64 vs. Other Encodings

| Encoding | Use Case | Size Overhead |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Base64 | Binary → Text | +33% |
| Base32 | Case-insensitive contexts | +60% |
| Hex | Debug, hashes | +100% |
| URL Encoding | URL parameters | Variable |

## Encode and Decode Instantly

Use our **[Base64 Encoder/Decoder](/tools/base64-encoder/)** to convert text and data to Base64 and back instantly. No data is sent to any server — everything runs in your browser.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Treating Base64 as encryption** — It provides zero security
2. **Encoding large files** — Use proper file upload mechanisms instead
3. **Double encoding** — Encoding already-encoded data creates bloat
4. **Ignoring padding** — Some implementations break without proper `=` padding
5. **Mixing Base64 and Base64URL** — They use different character sets

## Conclusion

Base64 encoding is a fundamental tool for transferring binary data through text-only channels. Use it for data URIs, email attachments, JWT tokens, and API payloads — but never mistake it for a security measure.
